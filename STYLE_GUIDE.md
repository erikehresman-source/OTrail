# Style Guide for OTrail

## Assets
- All images live under `assets/images/`.
- Use lowercase, hyphenated names (e.g., `wood-texture.png`).
- Always update references in `index.html`, `manifest.webmanifest`, and `service-worker.js`.

## UI
- Install App button: wood texture background, domed nail heads pinned in corners.
- Button text: rustic cream (#fdf5e6), shadowed for carved look.

## Performance
- Optimize PNGs with lossless compression.
- Keep icons at standard sizes (152, 192, 512).
