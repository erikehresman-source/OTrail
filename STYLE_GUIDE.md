# Style Guide for OTrail

## Assets
- All images live under `assets/images/`.
- Use lowercase, hyphenated filenames (e.g., wood-texture.png).
- Always update references in index.html, manifest.webmanifest, service-worker.js when adding new images.

## UI
- Install App button: wood texture background, domed nail heads pinned in corners.
- Button text: rustic cream (#fdf5e6), subtle shadow for carved look.

## Performance
- Optimize PNGs with lossless compression.
- Keep icons at 152, 192, and 512 sizes for compatibility.
